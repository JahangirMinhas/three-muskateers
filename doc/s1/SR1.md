Attendance: 
Jahangir Minhas, Junaid Khan, William Chik and Behrouz Akhbari were present at the meeting.

Unfinished Tasks:
Buttons on the game view except submit move still need to be implemented.
Parameters in the move method need to be edited so there are no extra unused parameters.
saveLog still needs to be linked with the button so it could work as planned.
Timer still needs to be implemented into the main GUI and more testing is needed to iron out all the bugs associated with it.

Practices to continue:
We should continue splitting the work between us and having regular meetings to help each other with the implementation of the design patterns and features.
We should also continue the peer review of code to make sure our code would run fine before we merge with the other branches.

New practices to use:
When working on classes or methods that related to our teammates’ parts, we should work together instead of working on our own, to avoid having merging issues in the end or to create redundant methods which achieve the same thing. This also allows us to have a better understanding of each others’ parts so we can implement our own classes more easily.

Harmful practices to avoid:
We should communicate with teammates better in the early stages of the project, so we can know in advanced if our classes would conflict with one another, and if our classes would need to be implemented in a different way to avoid conflicts in the future.

Best experiences during sprint 1:
We worked together as a team and with everyone’s help, successfully created a prototype of what we had planned during sprint0. Having teammates help each other with the coding process and review process is a great experience as debugging our own code is often very difficult, but with the help of a third party, usually makes it easier and quicker.
